Demo project built over **theMovieDb** API.

Build with `android architecture components`, clean architecture and designed with **Material design**

Main goals on this project:
 
* Easy to understand some concepts from Clean Architecture.
* Applies & follows design principles.
* Layer separation by packages to set clear boundaries between each layer.
* Easy to read, scale, test and maintain.
 
## Quick overview of the app

Code of this app is divided in packages, following clean architecture:

* data
    * cache
    * network
    
Classes related to framework and data, network connectivity, storage, ... 
    
* domain
    * repository
    * usecase
    
Business logic of the app
    
* ui
    * detail
    * movies
    * search
    * splash
    
Where screens belong

### TODO

- [x] Change *dagger* to [*koin*](https://insert-koin.io)
- [X] Refactor support libraries to [*androidX*](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/refactor)
- [ ] Create tablet mode
- [X] Split in modules instead of packages
- [ ] Add more small tests (repository test, use case, date parser)
    > On this project I decided to go through "flow" test, instead of specific class test, so it can test all related classes (API to ViewModel) all in once
     
- [ ] Add animations && transition between screens
